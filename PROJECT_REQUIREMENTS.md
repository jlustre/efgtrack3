# EFGTrack Business Rules & Project Requirements

This is the living requirements file for EFGTrack.com. Update it whenever business rules, access rules, workflows, or module decisions change.

## Project Purpose

EFGTrack.com is a private Experior Financial Group team portal for tracking new recruits, associates, onboarding, licensing, mentorship, training, assessments, resources, motivation, recognition, and rank advancement.

## Core Product Goals

- Give new recruits and associates a clear path from onboarding through licensing and apprenticeship.
- Give Certified Field Mentors a structured way to guide apprentices.
- Give team leaders and agency owners visibility into team progress.
- Keep training, assessments, resources, events, and announcements in one portal.
- Support rank advancement tracking from FA through EP.
- Use role-based access control so each user sees only what is appropriate.

## Core Roles

## Rank Path

## Global Business Rules

- EFGTrack is a private portal. Users must be authenticated to access core features.

- A user may have one or more roles.
- A user belongs to one current rank.
- A user may belong to a team.
- A user may have a sponsor.
- A prospective member may only register through an invitation link from a current EFGTrack member.
- Each invitation link must include a tracked registration code.
- A newly registered member must receive `sponsor_id` from the sponsoring member tied to the registration code.
- A newly registered member receives the default `member` role.
- A newly registered member receives the default `FA` rank.
- A newly registered member is placed on the same team as their sponsor.
- Only users with `super-admin`, `admin`, or `agency-owner` roles may change a user's role, rank, or team after registration.
- Unless information is explicitly tagged global, users may only see records inside their sponsorship hierarchy.
- Sponsorship hierarchy visibility includes direct recruits and all downline recruits under them.
- Only active Experior Financial Group associates may complete registration.
- Registration must collect the invited person's EFG Associate ID.
- Registration must show the sponsor tied to the invitation code and require the invited person to confirm that sponsor before continuing.
- If the displayed sponsor is not the correct sponsor, the invited person should discontinue registration and request a new invitation link from the correct sponsor.
- A user may have an assigned Certified Field Mentor.
- A New Recruit or Associate should not move through the apprenticeship process without a CFM assignment.
- Checklist items must identify who is responsible for confirmation and follow-up.
- Responsible party codes are Self, SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR, and may be combined.
- SP means the member's direct sponsor from the sponsorship hierarchy.
- Checklist items may identify who should be notified through notifications or email when the item is completed.
- Notified party codes are SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR, and may be combined.
- Notified parties are completion-alert recipients for the checklist item.

## Invitation Rules

- Active members may create invitation links from their member profile.
- Invitation links are tracked through `registration_invitations`.
- Invitation links are single-use by default.
- The system must prevent a new active invitation when the same email already has an active invitation.
- The system must prevent invitations to emails that already belong to registered EFGTrack users.
- A sponsor may preview and edit the invitation email before sending.
- The invitation email body must include the registration link.
- The invitation email popup must display this reminder below the message field: "The registration link must remain in the message. Add the recipient name before sending."
- Invitation email templates must be stored in the database for future management.
- Invitation emails must use the logged-in sponsor's name and email as the sender/reply-to identity.
- Successful registration must deactivate the invitation code.
- Accepted invitations must be hidden from the sponsor's Recent Invitations panel.
- Sponsors may delete active invitations, which revokes the invitation code.
- Deleted invitations may be recreated for the same email if the recipient has not registered.

## Certified Field Mentor Rules

- A member cannot see another sponsor line's information unless the information is tagged global or an explicit exception applies.
