| **Assignments** | Courses assigned by leaders, often with due dates |
| **Assessments** | Scored quizzes linked to courses |
| **Certifications** | Academy certificates, sometimes with mentor approval |

- **FAP sign-off** only when requirements are genuinely met
- Approve certifications promptly

**Trainers**
- Member-friendly titles — not internal jargon

- Run **monthly organization reports** for drop-off patterns

---

## 22. Troubleshooting

### Training menu missing

**Cause:** Account lacks dashboard access.  
**Fix:** Contact administrator.

### Course or path not visible

**Cause:** Draft or wrong audience.  
**Fix:** Only **published** content shows to members. Confirm path audience matches your role.

### Lesson locked

**Cause:** Sequential or drip rule.  
**Fix:** Complete prior lesson or wait for unlock date on course outline.

### Cannot take assessment

**Cause:** Incomplete lessons, no attempts, or already passed.  
**Fix:** Finish lessons; check attempts (max 3); passed assessments block retakes.

### Assignment still overdue after completion

**Cause:** Assessment not passed or page not refreshed.  
**Fix:** Pass required assessment; refresh. Contact assigner if stuck.

### Certification stuck on pending

**Cause:** Awaiting mentor approval.  
**Fix:** CFM approves at **Review requests**. Follow up after a few business days.

### Session not on calendar

**Cause:** Registration incomplete.  
**Fix:** Open session detail → **View in calendar**; check date range in Calendar.

### Permission denied (403)

See [Appendix J](#j-permission-reference).

### CFM Coaching shows no trainees

**Cause:** No active mentor assignment.  
**Fix:** Verify CFM assignment in agency management.
