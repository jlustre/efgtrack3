# Part 1 — Overview

## 1. What this module does

**FNA (Financial Needs Analysis)** helps you document a client’s or prospect’s financial picture, estimate protection needs, get CFM coaching, and prepare for client meetings — all inside EFGTrack.

### What you can do here

- **Collect facts** — nine-step wizard (client info, household, income, debt, assets, insurance, goals, risk, summary)
- **Quantify needs** — DIME analysis (Debt, Income, Mortgage, Education) with a protection gap estimate
- **Get mentor sign-off** — submit to your CFM before presenting to clients
- **Invite clients online** — secure links so prospects complete the FNA without an EFGTrack account
- **Stay organized** — link FNAs to prospects, schedule meetings, export PDFs, track status

> **Compliance reminder**  
> FNA and DIME tools are for **planning and coaching**. Results and AI suggestions are educational — not approved product recommendations. Follow your licensing, carrier, and company guidelines before advising clients.

|---|---|
| Draft | Yes |

## 9. DIME analysis

**DIME** = **D**ebt · **I**ncome · **M**ortgage · **E**ducation

It estimates how much additional protection a household may need and calculates a **protection gap**.

### Where to run it

| Location | Best for |
|---|---|
| Wizard → **DIME Analysis** tab | Saving DIME to the current FNA |
| **DIME Calculator** (`/team/fna/dime-calculator`) | Quick estimates; add `?fna={id}` to prefill |

### What goes into the calculation

| Component | Includes |
|---|---|
| **Debt** | Cards, loans, final expenses, other debt |
| **Income** | Years to replace (default: 10), inflation adjustment |
| **Mortgage** | Balance and payoff option |
| **Education** | Per-child cost (default: $100,000), inflation |
| **Offsets** | Existing life insurance, allocated liquid assets |
| **Result** | **Protection gap** — estimated shortfall |

Click **Save DIME to FNA** when done.

> *This analysis is for educational and planning purposes only. Product suitability must follow applicable compliance, licensing, and company guidelines.*

4. Confirm

**On success:** Status → **Submitted to CFM**. Your CFM is notified and may get a review task (48-hour target).

### Submission blocked?

| No CFM assignment | Check My Profile or contact upline |
| Wrong status | May already be submitted or approved |

| **Under CFM Review** | CFM is evaluating | Approve or request revision |

### Phase 3 — Client work (after approval)

## 21. Tasks, checklists, and notifications

### Tasks EFGTrack may create

| When… | Task example |
|---|---|
| Draft created | Complete FNA draft for {client} |
| Ready for review | Submit FNA to CFM for {client} |
| Submitted | Review FNA: {trainee} — {client} (CFM) |
| Revision requested | Revise FNA for {client} (urgent) |
| Approved | Schedule client FNA review for {client} |

Check **Tasks** in the sidebar.

### Training checklist links

| Checklist item | Opens |
|---|---|
| FAP Phase 5 — Financial Needs Analysis | FNA dashboard |
| CFM Phase 10 — FNA Assessment | CFM Review Queue |

### Notifications

- FNA **approved** or **revision requested** (associates)
- Trainee **submitted** an FNA (CFMs)
- Client **submitted** via portal (agents)

---

## 22. Tips and best practices

**Before CFM submission**
- Complete **DIME** — CFMs flag this as high priority
- Fill in **main financial concern** (step 8)
- Link the FNA to a **prospect** when applicable

**Client portal**
- Copy the **security code** immediately — it cannot be retrieved
- Send the link before your discovery call so the client arrives prepared

**Meetings**
- **Export PDF** before the appointment
- Schedule only **after CFM approval** (the system enforces this)

**Ongoing**
- Upload **attachments** to speed CFM review
- Respond quickly to **revision requests** — read the amber banner on your record
- Keep your **license number** current on My Profile

---

## 23. Troubleshooting

### FNA Management missing from sidebar

**Cause:** Your role lacks FNA access.  
**Fix:** Ask your administrator to enable FNA Management for your role.

---

### Submit to CFM disabled or fails

**Cause:** Completeness below 60%, no assigned CFM, or wrong status.  
**Fix:**

1. Finish wizard steps and save DIME
2. Confirm CFM assignment on My Profile
3. Check status — not already submitted/approved

---

### Cannot edit an FNA

**Cause:** Record is locked after submission.  
**Fix:** Editable only in Draft, Ready for Review, or Revision Requested. CFMs approve or request revision — they do not edit associate data.

---

### Send FNA Link missing

**Cause:** Missing license, permission, or linked prospect.  
**Fix:**

1. Add license number to My Profile
2. Confirm FNA Management access
3. On record page, link a prospect first for invites there

---

### Client cannot open invite

**Cause:** Expired, revoked, or wrong code.  
**Fix:**

| Issue | Action |
|---|---|
| Expired (30 days) | Create new invite |
| Revoked | Create new invite |
| Wrong / lost code | Create new invite (codes shown once) |
| Broken link | Use full URL from invite screen |

---

### DIME gap is blank

**Cause:** DIME not saved or missing income/debt inputs.  
**Fix:** Enter values → **Save DIME to FNA**.

---

### Export shows masked amounts

**Cause:** Financial-details access restricted on a shared record.  
**Fix:** You always see your own records fully. Shared views may mask dollars.

---

### CFM Review Queue empty

**Cause:** Filter too narrow, no submissions, or wrong CFM assignment.  
**Fix:** Try **All** filter; confirm trainees have submitted; verify you are their assigned CFM (or leader/owner).

---

### Agency reports empty

**Cause:** No downline FNA activity in scope.  
**Fix:** Reports populate as team members create and submit FNAs.

---

### Permission denied (403)

**Fix:** See [Section 2](#2-who-can-access-what) or [Appendix F](#f-permission-reference).
