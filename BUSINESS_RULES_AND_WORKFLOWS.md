# EFGTrack Business Rules And Workflows

This document defines the operating rules and primary workflows for EFGTrack.com. It should be treated as the source of truth for how users, teams, onboarding, licensing, mentorship, apprenticeship, training, assessments, resources, recognition, events, and rank advancement behave inside the portal.

## Portal Rules

- EFGTrack is a private portal for an Experior Financial Group team.
- Users must be authenticated before accessing the portal.
- Users must have an active account status to access protected areas.
- Access is controlled by role and permission using Spatie Laravel Permission.
- A user may have multiple roles when needed.
- A user may belong to one primary team.
- A user may have one sponsor.
- A visitor may only register as an EFGTrack member through an invitation link from a current EFGTrack member.
- Every invitation link must include a tracked registration code.
- Registration codes are stored and audited so the portal can identify who sponsored each new member.
- A newly registered member must receive `sponsor_id` from the sponsoring member tied to the invitation code.
- A newly registered member receives the default `member` role.
- A newly registered member receives the default `FA` rank.
- A newly registered member is assigned to the same team as their sponsor.
- Only users with `super-admin`, `admin`, or `agency-owner` roles may change a user's role, rank, or team after registration.
- Only active Experior Financial Group associates may complete registration.
- Registration must collect the user's EFG Associate ID.
- The invited person must confirm that the displayed sponsor is the person who invited them before registration can continue.
- If the displayed sponsor is not correct, the invited person should discontinue registration and request the correct invitation link from the correct sponsor.
- A user may have one active Certified Field Mentor assignment.
- A user has one current rank.
- Historical progress should be preserved when rank, team, mentor, or role changes occur.
- Unless content or information is explicitly tagged as global, users may only see information inside their sponsorship hierarchy.
- A user's visible hierarchy includes members they directly recruited and all recruits underneath those members.
- Checklist items must identify who is responsible for confirmation and follow-up.
- Responsible party codes are Self, SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR, and may be combined.
- SP means the member's direct sponsor from the sponsorship hierarchy.
- Checklist items may identify who should be notified through notifications or email when the item is completed.
- Notified party codes are SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR, and may be combined.
- Notified parties are completion-alert recipients for the checklist item.
- Calendar events may be private, shared with invited attendees, shared with a team, shared with a downline branch, or visible across the organization.
- Private calendar events are visible only to the organizer, invited attendees, or users with private-calendar authority.
- Calendar events tied to prospects, licensing, FAP, CFM, training, or rank advancement must respect the same hierarchy visibility rules as the related business record.

## Roles

- super-admin
- admin
- agency-owner
- team-leader
- certified-field-mentor
- trainer
- associate
- member
- new-recruit

## Rank And Role Distinction

- Ranks are Experior Financial Group advancement levels and represent business progression.
- Roles are EFGTrack application access groups and determine portal permissions.
- Rank changes do not automatically equal role changes unless an EFGTrack workflow explicitly grants the corresponding role.
- ED, SED, NED, and EP rank members usually qualify for the `agency-owner` role.
- SM rank members usually qualify for the `team-leader` role.
- The `certified-field-mentor` role may be granted to members at SFA rank and above after successfully completing CFM training and approval.
- The `trainer` role may be granted to members who successfully completed the Field Apprenticeship Program and have started CFM Training.
- Final role assignment remains controlled by authorized administrators unless automated approval workflows are implemented later.

## Rank Path

- FA - Field Associate
- SFA - Senior Field Associate
- SM - Sales Manager
- ED - Executive Director
- SED - Senior Executive Director
- NED - National Executive Director
- EP - Executive Partner

## Access Control Rules

- `super-admin` can manage the entire portal.
- `admin` can manage users and core setup tables, excluding low-level role ownership unless specifically granted.
- `agency-owner` can manage agency-level users, teams, training, onboarding, licensing, mentorship, announcements, events, and rank advancement.
- `team-leader` can view and manage assigned team members where permissions allow.
- `certified-field-mentor` can view assigned apprentices and update apprenticeship progress where permissions allow.
- `trainer` can manage training and assessments.
- `associate` can view personal progress, training, resources, events, recognition, announcements, and team information where allowed.
- `member` can view personal progress, training, resources, events, recognition, announcements, and team information where allowed.
- `new-recruit` can view personal onboarding, licensing, apprenticeship, starter training, events, resources, recognition, and announcements.

## Hierarchy Visibility Rules

- Sponsorship hierarchy is the default visibility boundary for non-global data.
- A user may see their own information, members they directly recruited, and all downline members recruited under those direct recruits.
- A user may not see another sponsor line's information unless the record is explicitly tagged global or an exception rule applies.
- Direct sponsorship is stored on `users.sponsor_id`.
- Fast downline visibility queries are powered by `user_hierarchy_paths`, a closure table containing ancestor, descendant, and depth.
- Sponsor relationship history is tracked in `sponsor_relationships`.
- Explicit visibility exceptions are tracked in `team_visibility_permissions`.
- `view direct downline` limits visibility to the member and first-level recruits unless another permission expands visibility.
- `view full downline` allows visibility into all descendant levels under the viewer's sponsorship branch.
- `view all teams` allows authorized platform-level users to view all team data.
- `export team data` is required before CSV export is available.
- `view sensitive profile data` is required before sensitive profile fields can be shown outside self-view or explicit visibility grants.
- Global information is visible across hierarchy boundaries when the content type and user permissions allow it.
- Roles grant actions and tools, but roles do not automatically override sponsorship hierarchy visibility unless a specific business exception is defined.
- Agency owners may see profile information for Certified Field Mentors from other agencies for CFM discovery and mentor assignment planning.
- Cross-agency CFM visibility is limited to CFM profile information needed for assignment decisions and does not grant general access to another agency's downline.
- An agency owner's own CFM pool has first priority for mentor assignment before considering CFMs from other agencies.
- Only agency owners may assign a CFM to a new member under their sponsorship hierarchy.

## User Lifecycle Workflow

1. A current EFGTrack member creates or provides an invitation link with a tracked registration code.

4. The new user's `sponsor_id` is set to the sponsoring member tied to the invitation code.
5. The invitation record stores usage and accepted user details for tracking.

6. The invitation email message must keep the registration link in the body.
7. The invitation email popup must remind the sender to add the recipient name before sending.
8. The invitation email sender name and reply-to identity must use the logged-in sponsor's profile details.

17. The new member account is created with `sponsor_id` set to the sponsor's user ID.
18. The new member account receives the `member` role, `FA` rank, and the sponsor's current team.
19. The registration invitation records `accepted_by`, `accepted_at`, and updated usage count.
20. After successful registration, the invitation code must be deactivated so it cannot be reused.
21. Accepted invitations must not appear in the sponsor's Recent Invitations panel.
22. A sponsor may delete an active invitation, which deactivates the code.
