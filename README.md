## 3. Database Schema Plan

Core identity:

- `users`: Breeze auth user plus rank, team, sponsor, mentor, active flags.
- `registration_invitations`: tracked invitation codes, sponsor, invited email, usage, expiry, email delivery, acceptance, and revocation state.
- `email_templates`: database-managed templates for invitation and future portal emails.
- `profiles`: extended user data, phone, province/state, license number, recruit date.
- `ranks`: FA through EP.
- `teams`: hierarchical team ownership and leadership.

Tracking:

- `licensing_steps`, `user_licensing_progress`
- `onboarding_steps`, `user_onboarding_progress`
- `rank_requirements`, `user_rank_progress`

Training and assessment:

- `training_categories`, `training_modules`, `training_lessons`, `training_progress`
- `assessments`, `questions`, `answers`, `assessment_attempts`

Content and engagement:

- `resources`, `events`, `announcements`, `badges`

Certified Field Mentor:

- `mentor_assignments`
- `apprenticeship_programs`, `apprenticeship_steps`, `user_apprenticeship_progress`
- `mentor_notes`
- `cfm_training_modules`, `cfm_training_progress`
- `cfm_certification_requests`

## 4. Models And Relationships

- `User hasOne Profile`
- `User belongsTo Rank`
- `User belongsTo Team`
- `User belongsTo sponsor User`
- `User belongsTo mentor User`
- `User hasMany apprentices through mentor_assignments`
- `Team belongsTo owner User`

- `CfmCertificationRequest belongsTo user`

## 5. Roles And Permissions

Invitation and registration rules:

- EFGTrack is invitation-only; public registration without a valid invitation code is blocked.
- Each invitation link includes a tracked registration code and sponsor.
- New members inherit `sponsor_id` from the member tied to the invitation code.
- Registration requires EFG Associate ID, active Experior Financial Group associate confirmation, and sponsor confirmation.
- If the displayed sponsor is incorrect, the invited person should discontinue registration and request the correct invitation link.
- The system prevents duplicate active invitations for the same email and prevents invitations to already registered emails.
- Successful registration deactivates the invitation code.
- Accepted invitations are hidden from the sponsor's Recent Invitations panel.
- Sponsors may delete active invitations, which revokes the code and allows a new invitation to that email if the person has not registered.
- Sponsors can preview and edit invitation emails; the message must keep the registration link and reminds the sender to add the recipient name.
- Invitation emails use the logged-in sponsor's name and email identity.

Roles:

- super-admin
- admin
- agency-owner
- team-leader
- certified-field-mentor
- trainer
- associate
- member
- new-recruit

Rank and role distinction:

- Ranks are Experior Financial Group advancement levels.
- Roles are EFGTrack access and permission groups.
- ED and above usually carry the `agency-owner` role.
- SM usually carries the `team-leader` role.
- CFM can be granted to SFA and above after successful CFM Training completion and approval.
- Trainer can be granted after successful Field Apprenticeship Program completion and once CFM Training has started.

Hierarchy visibility:

- Sponsorship hierarchy is the default visibility boundary for non-global information.
- A member can see themselves, direct recruits, and all downline recruits under those direct recruits.
- Information tagged global may be visible outside hierarchy boundaries when permissions allow it.
- Roles grant actions and tools, but do not automatically bypass hierarchy visibility.
- Only agency owners may assign a CFM to a new member under their sponsorship hierarchy.
- Agency owners should prioritize their own CFM pool before considering CFMs from other agencies.
- Agency owners may see CFM profile information from other agencies for assignment planning only.

Checklist accountability:

- Checklist items include responsible parties for confirmation and follow-up.
- Responsible party codes are Self, SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR.
- SP means the member's direct sponsor from the sponsorship hierarchy.
- Responsible parties may be combined, for example `Self, CFM` or `AO, TR`.
- Checklist items may include notified parties who receive notifications or email when an item is completed.
- Notified party codes are SP, AO, TL, CFM, and TR.
- Notified parties are completion-alert recipients for the checklist item.
- Onboarding checklist items move to pending confirmation when checked and become completed only after a notified party confirms them.
- Notified parties can add review comments and either confirm or reject pending onboarding items.
- This applies to onboarding, licensing, Field Apprenticeship Program, and CFM Training checklists.

- view dashboard
- manage users
- manage roles

Recommended role matrix:

- super-admin: all permissions

- associate: dashboard, own onboarding/licensing/training/assessments/rank/resources/events
- member: dashboard, team, personal progress, and member resources
- new-recruit: dashboard, onboarding, licensing, field apprenticeship, training basics, resources

## 6. Route Structure

Use authenticated routes with permission middleware. Admin areas should be role or permission gated.

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified', 'active'])->group(function () {
    Route::view('/dashboard', 'dashboard')->middleware('permission:view dashboard')->name('dashboard');

    Route::view('/onboarding', 'onboarding.index')->name('onboarding.index');
    Route::view('/licensing', 'licensing.index')->name('licensing.index');
    Route::view('/tasks', 'tasks.index')->name('tasks.index');
    Route::view('/field-apprenticeship', 'apprenticeship.index')->name('apprenticeship.index');
    Route::view('/training', 'training.index')->name('training.index');
    Route::view('/assessments', 'assessments.index')->name('assessments.index');
    Route::view('/rank-advancement', 'rank-advancement.index')->name('rank-advancement.index');
    Route::view('/team', 'team.index')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.index');
    Route::view('/team/directs', 'team.directs')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.directs');
    Route::view('/team/trainees', 'team.trainees')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.trainees');
    Route::view('/team/cfms', 'team.cfms')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.cfms');
    Route::view('/team/downlines', 'team.downlines')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.downlines');
    Route::view('/team/prospects', 'team.prospects')->middleware('permission:view team')->name('team.prospects');
    Route::view('/resources/documents', 'resources.documents')->name('resources.documents');
    Route::view('/resources/videos', 'resources.videos')->name('resources.videos');
    Route::view('/resources/recorded-webinars', 'resources.recorded-webinars')->name('resources.recorded-webinars');
    Route::view('/resources/zoom-links', 'resources.zoom-links')->name('resources.zoom-links');
    Route::view('/events', 'events.index')->name('events.index');
    Route::view('/calendar', 'events.index')->name('calendar.index');
    Route::view('/recognition', 'recognition.index')->name('recognition.index');
    Route::view('/announcements', 'announcements.index')->name('announcements.index');
    Route::view('/notifications', 'notifications.index')->name('notifications.index');

    Route::prefix('admin')->name('admin.')->middleware('role:super-admin|admin|agency-owner|team-leader|certified-field-mentor|trainer')->group(function () {
        Route::view('/settings', 'admin.settings')->name('settings');
        Route::view('/users', 'admin.users.index')->middleware('permission:manage users')->name('users.index');
        Route::view('/roles', 'admin.roles.index')->middleware('permission:manage roles')->name('roles.index');
        Route::view('/ranks', 'admin.ranks.index')->middleware('permission:manage ranks')->name('ranks.index');
        Route::view('/training', 'admin.training.index')->middleware('permission:manage training')->name('training.index');
        Route::view('/cfm-certification', 'admin.cfm.index')->middleware('permission:manage CFM certification')->name('cfm.index');
    });
});
```

## 7. Middleware Setup

Register aliases in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {
    $middleware->alias([
        'role' => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
        'permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\PermissionMiddleware::class,
        'role_or_permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middleware\RoleOrPermissionMiddleware::class,
        'active' => \App\Http\Middleware\EnsureUserIsActive::class,
    ]);
})
```
