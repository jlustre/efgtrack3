# Calendar & Events Module

## Purpose

The Calendar & Events module gives EFGTrack a Google/Outlook-style scheduling center for team events, trainings, prospect appointments, licensing deadlines, mentor sessions, Field Apprenticeship Program sessions, CFM certification, rank reviews, recognition, and organization-wide events.

## Implemented Scaffold

- Calendar routes for month, week, day, agenda, settings, event detail, and export.
- Calendar UI with fixed workspace layout: left controls, center calendar grid, right upcoming-events panel, and mobile floating create button.
- Calendar database schema with categories, event types, events, attendees, reminders, recurrences, attachments, visibility rules, notes, activity logs, and user preferences.
- Calendar models and relationships.
- Calendar policies for event visibility, attendees, reminders, visibility rules, and export.
- Calendar seed data for realistic EFGTrack scenarios.
- Livewire component stubs for future modal and real-time interactions.
